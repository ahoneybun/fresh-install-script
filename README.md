# fresh-install-script
A script to help me update, upgrade and install my most used software in a quick and clean manner.

A lot of the bash credit goes to Marius Quabeck for his awesome magic-device-tool: https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool

Notes
-------
The Chrome install option is a WIP and selecting it will move to the next step of the script.
