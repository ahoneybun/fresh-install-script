# Fresh Install Script
Version 2.2

A script to help me update, upgrade and install my most used software in a quick and clean manner for clean installs. This script reads the /etc/os-release for the PRETTY_NAME line so if that doesn't match the supported distros below then it won't work. 

Support for the following distros:

- [x] Arch (it *should* support Arch based distros as well)
- [x] Fedora 
- [x] Pop!_OS. 
- [x] Ubuntu (may or may not support Debian though elementary OS and Linux Mint should be fine)

A lot of the bash credit goes to Marius Quabeck for his awesome magic-device-tool: https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool
