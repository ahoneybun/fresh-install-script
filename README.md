# Fresh Install Script
Version 2.2

A script to help me update, upgrade and install my most used software in a quick and clean manner for clean installs. This script reads the /etc/os-release for the PRETTY_NAME line so if that doesn't match the supported distros below then it won't work.
Support for the following distros:

- [x] Arch
- [ ] Garuda (Still needs testing)
- [x] Fedora 
- [x] Pop!_OS. 
- [x] Ubuntu

A lot of the bash credit goes to Marius Quabeck for his awesome magic-device-tool: https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool

(thanks @JJ for the fixes in this README)
